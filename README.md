# Data Management and Analysis over Social Media Influencers Marketing

## Project Description
The domain of our project is the logistics of social media influencer marketing. This project primarily addresses the data related to influencers on social media and their collaboration with sponsors to promote products through posts. By modeling this aspect of the domain, we want our application to target people who are interested in the economics of influencer marketing to discover insightful trends and information from a database that contains data generated by the influencer industry. Their discoveries may further help them in either their own career or enhance their understanding of the social media influencer economy.
